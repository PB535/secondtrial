<h1>PB's Top Three Movies</h1>
<h2>These Movies are best according to me</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>This movie depicts the story of a smart individual who is imprisoned for a crime that he didnt commit and eventually leaves the prison by a Jail Break</p>
<h3>God Father</h3>
<p>This depicts the Crime syndicate being born in new york and the crime mafia and the godfather shows his ruthlessness but also love for his family and the complexities of the mafia trade</p>
<h3>Bruce Almighty</h3>
<p>The story defines the flaws of just being a human and the selfishness that is primal to being a human.</p>
